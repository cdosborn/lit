# [/ ](root.html)Code.hs - generates the Code from a literate file

Code is a module which transforms the main data structure 
for a parsed `lit` file into the actual source. By expanding all 
macros and ignoring the narrative, the Code module produces the
portion intended for computer interpretation.`lit` in theory is 
language independent, as it does not make assumptions about the 
language stored within. The arbitrary macro `<< * >>=` communicates
to Code the starting point of the document, comparable to a 
table of contents. Code then proceeds to build the document expanding
macro references and joining macro extensions.

An overview of the file:
    << * >>=
    << define Code module >>
    << import modules >>
    << generate a code file from chunks >>
    << helper functions >>

Code only exports `generate` akin to Html and Markdown, the other output modules.
    << define Code module >>=
    {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
    module Code ( generate ) where

Code relies on a HashMap, where the keys are macro names and the values `Chunk`. 
Despite being of type `Chunk` all values constructed from `Prose` are ignored leaving
only `Def`. For more information on types see Types.hs
    << import modules >>=
    import Data.List (partition)
    import qualified Data.HashMap.Strict as Map
    import qualified Data.Text as T

    import Types

`generate` is the interface for the module. `lit` generates the `[Chunk]` with Parse.hs
before calling `generate` to make the code file from a `lit` file. It performs: 

1. Filtering out all `Prose` 
2. Merging macro definitions with the same name
3. Expanding macros and references to just lines of code

    << generate a code file from chunks >>=
    generate :: [Chunk] -> T.Text
    generate = expand . merge . (filter isDef)


`generate` depends on the following helper functions.
    << helper functions >>=
    << merge chunks with the same name >>
    << reduce chunks into one >>
    << expand chunk references with chunks >>


`merge` allows for a macro extension. By reusing a macro definition,
narrative can be interweaved into code.
    << merge chunks with the same name >>=
    merge :: [Chunk] -> [Chunk]
    merge = mergeAux []

The same macro definition was used, and `lit` will merge both into
one when it generates the final code file. `merge` creates a list
of macros with the same name to be combined.
    << merge chunks with the same name >>=
    mergeAux ans [] = ans
    mergeAux ans (next:rest) = 
        let 
            name = getName next
            chunkHasName name = (== name) . getName
            (found, rem) = partition (chunkHasName name) rest 
            merged = combineChunks (next:found)
        in 
            mergeAux (merged:ans) rem

`combineChunks` assumes a list of macros with the same name. It returns
a new `Chunk` that has the combined inner `[Part]` of the list, but sharing
the line number and name of the first. Since `combineChunks` reduces a list to 
a value, it cannot be passed an empty list.
    << reduce chunks into one >>=
    combineChunks :: [Chunk] -> Chunk
    combineChunks (a:[]) = a
    combineChunks l@(c:cs) = Def line name parts 
        where
            parts = concatMap getParts l
            name = getName c
            line = getLineNo c

`expand` assumes a list of only `Def` of type `Chunk` which hold the actual code
or references to other 'Def' which hold code. First it creates a map of (macro name, macro)
of more precisely (`Text`,`Chunk`). It then searches for the root macro name `*`, resorting
to the first macro definition, and recursively expands the different parts of the root.
(`<< * >>=`) to begin expansion
    << expand chunk references with chunks >>=
    expand :: [Chunk] -> T.Text
    expand chunks =
        let 
            -- map (name, parts)
            partMap = Map.fromList $ zip (map getName chunks) (map getParts chunks)
            backup = getParts $ last chunks
            parts = Map.lookupDefault backup "*" partMap 
        in
            expandParts parts partMap T.empty

`expand` from above relies on `expandParts` to actually perform the recursive lookup. Each
call to `expandParts` returns text if the part is simply a code line (`Code line`) or the 
text which results from expanding a reference to its code lines. If the part is a reference (`Ref name`), 
`expandParts` looks up the name of the macro in the map, and proceeds to pull out the code lines
in that macro. Refer to Types.hs for clarity on the different wrapper types mentioned here.
    << expand chunk references with chunks >>=
    expandParts :: [Part] -> Map.HashMap T.Text [Part] -> T.Text -> T.Text
    expandParts parts partMap baseIndent =
        let 
            toText = (\part -> 
                case part of
                Code txt -> T.append baseIndent txt
                Ref name indent -> expandParts refParts partMap (T.append baseIndent indent)
                    where refParts = Map.lookupDefault [] (T.strip name) partMap)
        in 
            T.concat (map toText parts) `T.append` "\n"
